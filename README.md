# 🎬 Netflix Cards in React

This is my first React project — a simple Netflix-style cards app that displays a list of movies or series with details like name, rating, genre, and cast.  
I built this project while learning the basics of **React.js**, including components, props, CSS styling, and data mapping.

## 🚀 Features

- Display movies/series using data from a JSON file  
- Each card shows:
  - Poster image  
  - Name  
  - Rating (highlighted with color based on value)  
  - Description (trimmed with ellipsis)  
  - Cast and Genre  
  - “Watch Now” button with link  
- Header and Footer components  
- Custom CSS styling for hover, buttons, and layout

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Setting up a React project with **Vite**  
- Using **functional components**  
- Passing data through **props**  
- Applying **conditional rendering and classNames**  
- Organizing components and CSS files
